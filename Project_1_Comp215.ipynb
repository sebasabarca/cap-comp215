The easier way I found was to use Wikipedia because they have a big base data of many topics. The next funtion takes a topic that should be separated by '_' instead of spaces, insert it into the wikipedia link and then get the text using the Beatifulsoup library.  The only problem with this is that in wikipedia some words have numbers attached to them and this may generate weird words in the predicted sentence. I can't take out the numbers because they may be single values like dates or numbers that make sense to the sentence."
